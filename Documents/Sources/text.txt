The main mediating variable is believed to be proprioception (balance and muscle-contraction coordination) during the game. 
Starting at the top of the figure, the coach affects the team-motivation (including aggressiveness), 
which affects both the probability of previous injury and the player's compliance with warm-up exercises. 
A player's genetics affects their fitness level (along with the coach's fitness program) and whether there are any 
inherent connective tissue disorders (which leads to tissue weakness and injury). Both connectivetissuedisorders and 
fitness level affect neuromuscular fatigue, which independently affects proprioception during the game and the probability of injury. 
Finally, if the sport is a contactsport, the probability of previousinjury is greater, as is the probability of minor bruises during 
the game that would affect proprioception. Although other causal models are also possible, we will use this one for illustrative purposes 
at this time. For this example, we have decided to include neuromuscular fatigue (Z1) and tissue weakness (Z2) in the statistical model. 
Step #1 is to ensure that these covariates are not descendants of (i.e. directly or indirectly caused by) warm-up exercises. 
Step 2 is illustrated in 2b. The open circle (previous injury, Z3) represents the only non-ancestor 
(an ancestor is direct or indirect cause of another variable) of warm up exercises (X), neuromuscular fatigue (Z1), 
tissue weakness (Z2) and injury (Outcome)
