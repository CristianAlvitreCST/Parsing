Abstract 

We systematically reviewed whether the number
of teeth is related to all-cause or circulatory mortality and
whether replaced teeth are protective against all-cause or
circulatory mortality. The search was based on the PubMed
database. All cohort studies published in peer-reviewed
journals were selected. Studies on periodontal disease and
mortality were excluded if they did not provide information
on the number of teeth. Risk estimates from studies with
appropriate exposure definition, confounder adjustment and
sample size were included in a meta-analysis. Three high-
quality studies found a relationship between the number of
teeth and circulatory mortality, whereas a moderate study
did not. Two out of four moderate- to high-quality studies
reported a relationship between the number of teeth and all-
cause mortality. No study has investigated whether replaced
teeth are protective against mortality. Therefore, denture use
was taken as proxy. The methodological quality of studies
on denture use and mortality was generally low to
moderate. The findings of two moderate studies indicated
an effect of prosthodontic replacements on all-cause
mortality, which was supported in bias analysis. It is open 
whether competing risks of cause-specific death other than
circulatory mortality reduce an effect of the number of teeth
on all-cause mortality. An effect of denture use on
circulatory mortality remains to be established, as well as
whether the number of replaced teeth affects mortality.
Specifying the role of potential pathways by which tooth
loss-related mortality is mediated will possibly increase the
value of dental treatment for general health.

Introduction

The number of teeth is discussed to predict all-cause and
circulatory mortality. Two major pathways may mediate
this relationship, including (1) the effects of masticatory
dysfunction on dietary behaviour, nutrition and systemic
diseases [1–4] and (2) the inflammatory effects of chronic
periodontal infection on the circulatory system [5–7]. If
tooth loss was a risk factor, its attributable fraction will be
relevant because it is more common [8], from younger age
onwards, than hypertension [9] as one of the primary
predictors of circulatory mortality.
The role of the prosthodontic status has been rarely
examined for the possible relationship between the number
of teeth and mortality [10]. If the rehabilitation of missing
teeth by wearing dental prostheses has the potential to
change masticatory efficiency and diet [11–13], replacing
missing teeth may hypothetically have an effect on
mortality. The prosthodontic status is a time-dependent
exposure, as further tooth loss may occur or missing teeth
be replaced. If tooth loss is measured at baseline only, its
risk on mortality is underestimated because some subjects 
will improve their prosthodontic status (receive a prosthesis
for missing teeth during the observation period) and some
subjects will deteriorate (loose teeth during the observation
period without replacement). Such non-differential misclas-
sification following the baseline examination was described
earlier for the risk of periodontal disease on cardiovascular
disease [14]. Consequently, a long observation period is not
only linked with a higher chance for changes in the dental
status but it is also preferable to observe fatal events.
A highly relevant methodological factor for judging
whether tooth loss or prosthodontic replacement plays a
causal role for mortality is to consider the concept of
confounding. A confounder is related both to the outcome
and the exposure, and non-considering a confounder may
overestimate the exposure effect. On the other hand, a
confounder may also suppress the relationship of interest.
To choose appropriate confounder sets, an innovative
epidemiologic tool, namely, directed acyclic graphs
(DAGs), has been suggested [15–17]. This combined
analytical and graphical approach allows alternative con-
founder sets and may be particularly instructive for
systematic reviews.
Based on these methodological aspects, we systematically
reviewed (1) whether the number of teeth is related to all-
cause or circulatory mortality and (2) whether replaced teeth
are protective against all-cause or circulatory mortality.

Materials and methods

Search strategy

Literature searches were independently executed by three of
the authors (I.P., C.S. and H.V.) using two strategies.
Firstly, the PubMed database (1966 to May 2010) was
screened to detect articles published in the English
language on the association between the number of teeth
and all-cause mortality/circulatory mortality or replaced
teeth and all-cause mortality/circulatory mortality. The
search was restricted to studies on human subjects by
selecting the respective option provided by the PubMed
search engine. For assessing a putative lifetime effect of the
number of teeth, the Boolean search formulation was:
(tooth OR teeth OR “tooth loss” OR “tooth number” OR
“number of teeth” OR “dental disease” OR “dental status”)
AND (survival OR mortality OR death OR fatal OR
lethal). To evaluate a putative beneficial effect of prostho-
dontic replacements, the Boolean search formulation was:
(“replaced teeth” OR denture OR “dental prosthesis” OR
“dental prostheses” OR RPD OR FPD) AND (survival OR
mortality OR death OR fatal OR lethal). Secondly, after the
electronic search, manual searches were made through
reference lists from original research and review articles.

Study selection

All cohort studies published in peer-reviewed journals were
considered for the present review. Studies on the associa-
tion between the number of teeth and non-fatal circulatory
events were excluded, as were studies on periodontal
disease and mortality if they did not provide information
on the number of teeth. Highly selected study populations
were a further criterion for exclusion.

Quality assessment of selected studies

The selected studies were assessed for the exposure, the
intermediates, the sample size and the confounders. With
respect to confounding, we classified the studies into risk and
prediction models [18]. In a risk model, a confounder is
associated with both the outcome and the exposure, but must
not be an effect of the exposure [19]. To assess a confounder,
it would not be appropriate to use stepwise selection
procedures because they ignore the relation between the risk
factor and the exposure. Stepwise modelling makes more
sense for prediction models [19]. The sample size was
considered insufficient if less than ten outcome events per
variable were available in prediction models or five events
per variable in risk models [20]. If the number of events is
less than the corresponding critical value, the results may be
biased and should be cautiously interpreted [20].

Potential confounders

Many confounders (age [21, 22], sex [21, 22]), social
determinants such as socioeconomic status (SES) and marital
status [22, 23], smoking [21–24], risky alcohol consumption
[23, 24], physical activity [23, 25], metabolic factors such as
diabetes and obesity [21–23], serum lipids such as triglycer-
ides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol [26, 27], hypertension [22, 28], oral
health behaviour [23, 25], periodontitis [29, 30] and caries
[31]) have been considered for the relationship between the
number of teeth and mortality. To reduce such a high number
of potential confounders to minimal adjustment sets that are
sufficient to control confounding, the DAG approach was
used [16, 17]; for example, in Online Fig. 1 (Online Resource
1, p 9), the DAG for the teeth–mortality relation is drawn
(generated by DAGitty v0.9b available at http://www.dagitty.
net/dags.html). The confounder selection depends on the
exposure of interest [19]. We investigated the effect of the
number of teeth (I) or related oral exposures (number of
contacts on natural teeth, II; presence of prostheses, III;
number of unreplaced teeth, IV). The obtained minimally
sufficient adjustment sets for different oral exposures (I–IV)
used in selected studies and under different assumptions are
presented in Online Table 1 (Online Resource 1, p 7).

The DAG approach clarifies that an exposure mixture of
oral variables may be misleading. Moreover, the problem of
residual confounding by smoking, which has been exten-
sively discussed for the relationship between oral exposures
and circulatory outcomes, may potentially be avoided by
using DAGs.
Based on extensive DAG analysis, smoking and diabetes
as the clinically most important (except periodontal disease)
were considered for the quality assessment of studies with
the exposure to the number of teeth. Age, sex, social
determinants (SES) and the number of teeth were consid-
ered for the quality assessment of the studies on denture use
or related exposures.
Additional methodological information on the selection
of potential confounders based on DAGs is given in Online
Resource 1 (pp 2 and 3).

According to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based
Medicine [32], there are four levels of evidence: from level
A, evidence from high-quality homogeneous randomised
controlled trials (RCTs), to level D, weak evidence from
inconsistent or inconclusive studies [32]. ‘RCTs are unethical
if the intervention is already known to be superior to the
control in the population under investigation’ [33]. Since the

Clin Oral Invest (2012) 16:333–351
335


relation between the number of natural or replaced teeth and
mortality should not be examined within the scope of
randomised clinical trials for ethical reasons, the highest
possible level of recommendation is B, evidence based on
cohort studies. Given evidence based on low- to moderate-
quality cohort studies, the level of recommendation will be C.

Bias analysis

For the putative relationship between prosthodontic replace-
ments and mortality, SES may be an important confounder,
which is supported by DAGs (Online Resource 1, Online
Table 1, p 7). If published results were not adjusted for SES,
the effect of missing prosthodontic replacements on mortality
is likely to be overestimated. The lack of confounder control
can be diminished by bias analyses as recommended by
experts for meta-analysis [34]. Here, we performed a
probabilistic bias analysis [35] and chose study-specific bias
assumptions as described in the supplementary material
(Online Resource 1, pp 3 and 4). To decide for a relevant
bias, we used the change-in-estimate criterion for risk models,
which is usually fixed for a 10% change [19]. The simulation
estimate and its interval, which are reflections of the combined
data and bias analysis assumptions, were added to the
conventional estimate and confidence interval in Table 2.

Results

General description of selected studies

Applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, in total, 23
cohort studies [36–58] were selected for qualitative synthe-
sis (Fig. 1).
As to the database search on tooth loss and mortality, six
investigations [37, 38, 42, 54, 58, 59] were assigned to the
denture use analysis. Other studies were not considered
since they assessed tooth loss solely as an exposure
category of periodontal disease [60–64], treated the number
of teeth as a score variable [65, 66] or a confounding
variable only [67] or no quantitative data have been given
[68, 69]. One study was excluded for evaluating only
incident tooth loss [70]. Between two studies [43, 44], an
overlap of 94 subjects existed. Because the exposures were
defined differently, both reports were included. Finally,
three studies [25, 71, 72] were excluded for not assessing
fatal events of disease separately from non-fatal outcomes.
There was no study on the relationship between the number
of replaced teeth and mortality. Therefore, denture use was
taken as proxy. As to the eligibility of denture-related studies,
one investigation [59] was excluded, being based on data also
used in another publication [37]. Two studies reported no
quantitative data and were, therefore, not included [57, 60].

A descriptive summary of the selected studies is given in
Tables 1 and 2; declared risk factors were not restricted to
those in the final model. Most of the studies were conducted
in Europe [37, 40, 43–46, 49, 50, 52, 55–57] or Japan [38,
41, 42, 48, 54, 58], four in the United States [39, 47, 51, 53]
and one in China [36]. Study participants were recruited
from the general population [36–46, 48–53, 57, 58], nursing
facilities [54], registers [47, 55] and a university hospital
[56]. Sample sizes ranged widely from 94 [43] to 41,000
subjects [39] in studies on all-cause mortality and from 1,462
[40] to 58,974 subjects [47] in studies on circulatory
mortality (Table 1). In studies that considered denture use
as exposure, the range was 697 [38] to 1,929 subjects [54]
(Table 2). Denture-related studies did not analyse circulatory
mortality as outcome. Similarly, the follow-up times differed
and were at minimum 5 [43] or 6 years [47] and at maximum
57 years [56] in studies on all-cause or circulatory mortality
(Table 1). In studies exploring the putative relation between
denture use and mortality (Table 2), there were shorter
observation periods of 4 [38] to 15 years [37].

Number of teeth and all-cause/circulatory mortality

There were 15 studies [36, 39–41, 43–46, 48–52, 55, 56] that
investigated the relation between the number of teeth and all-
cause mortality and 9 studies [36, 39, 40, 46, 47, 49, 52, 56,
57] that investigated the effect on circulatory mortality
(Table 1). Irrespective of the assessed quality, 12 [36, 39–41,
43–46, 49–51, 55] out of 15 studies reported an increased
risk of unspecific death among women or men with higher
numbers of missing teeth, while 7 [36, 39, 40, 46, 47, 49, 56]
out of 9 studies revealed increased circulatory mortality.
Study findings are limited by low number of events [20] in
relation to the number of variables in the final model (for all-
cause mortality: Table 3 [48, 51] and for circulatory
mortality: Table 4 [57]). Notably, in one study [57], sample
size considerations were not reported, although statistically
non-significant findings were yielded for a low number of
events. Findings are further limited by using prediction
models [43, 44, 49–51, 55]. Moreover, the confounder sets
of the studies were quite heterogeneous. Few risk models
lacked adjustment for clinically relevant confounders such as
smoking [39, 41] and diabetes [41, 46, 52] (Tables 3 and 4).
Potential residual confounding by smoking was addressed in
three studies by performing sensitivity analysis [36], using
the number of cigarettes per day for current and former
smokers [47], or stratifying by smoking status [56]. Tu et al.
[56] reported separate analyses for smokers and non-smokers
only for the association between tooth loss and circulatory
mortality; for that relationship, the methodological quality
scoring was, therefore, higher (Table 4) than for the all-cause
mortality analyses (Table 3). Four studies [39, 45, 46, 52]
discussed residual confounding qualitatively without trying

336

to quantify the effect, for instance, in a bias analysis.
Quantification of the bias effect would have been advisable
at least for Brown et al. [39]. In contrast, over-adjustment
might be present for vitamin supplementation [47].
Different exposure definitions, namely, dichotomous (for
example, >10 teeth), log-linear (continuous number of teeth)
or potentially non-log-linear (categories, fractional polyno-
mials), were used across studies (Table 1). Two studies [49,
56], having found a higher mortality risk, specified whether a
linear exposure effect could be assumed. Whereas one study
[49] revealed linearity, the other did not [56]. Notably, in two
studies [36, 50], the number of teeth was not examined by
dental professionals. In a study of health professionals,
participants indicated their number of teeth (0, 1–10, 11–16,
17–24, 25–32 teeth) in a self-administered questionnaire
[47]. Change in exposures or time-dependent variables were
analysed by Hung et al. [47] only.

All studies had an observation period of at least 5 years.
Four studies followed up the population for more than
15 years [40, 45, 49, 56]. The empirical induction period
was not analysed. The age ranged from 16 [56] to at least
85 years [43] at baseline. Some studies specifically
investigated mortality in elderly (65–79 years) [45, 49,
50] or very old populations (≥80 years) [43, 44, 48, 55].
Two studies observed selected samples for which high
health awareness may be assumed [47, 56].

the number of teeth and circulatory mortality, which was
moderate to high in half of all studies, compared with
studies addressing all-cause mortality as outcome. Gener-
ally, lower quality scorings of the selected studies were
partly attributable to a research question different from
those of the present systematic review. Cabrera et al. [40],
for example, assessed whether the SES can explain the
relation between tooth loss and circulatory mortality; for
that aim (SES as exposure), smoking would be an
intermediary variable rather than a confounder.
Based on quality assessment, valid results for all-cause
mortality can be assumed for Abnet et al. [36] and, to an
essentially lower grade, for Holm-Pedersen et al. [45],
Ragnarsson et al. [52] and Tu et al. [56]. Exposures differ
across moderate- to high-quality studies [36, 45, 52, 56].
Therefore, a pooled estimation would be feasible only for
two moderate studies [52, 56], both analysing the number
of teeth as continuous variable. Quantitative synthesis
ignoring high-quality data could be misleading and was,
therefore, not performed. Two [36, 45] out of four
moderate- to high-quality studies (Table 3), however,
reported a relationship between the number of teeth and
all-cause mortality (Table 1).
Valid results for circulatory mortality can be assumed for
Abnet et al. [36], Hung et al. [47] and Tu et al. [56] (Table 4),
who all have found a relationship between the exposure and
the outcome (Table 1) and, to an essentially lower grade, for
Ragnarsson et al. [52], who revealed no relationship between
the number of teeth and circulatory mortality. A meta-analysis
of the studies was not feasible for similar reasons as for well-
designed studies on all-cause mortality; discrepancy in
definitions of the exposures would demand exclusion of the
two studies with the largest sample size [36, 47].

Denture use and all-cause mortality

No study particularly investigated whether the number of
replaced or unreplaced teeth affects mortality. Six inves-
tigations [37, 38, 42, 53, 54, 58] explored the putative
relation between denture use and all-cause mortality. The
study of Semba et al. [53] was not further considered, since
the exposure mixture to denture use and difficulty in
chewing or swallowing was not suitable for the aim of
our review. Four [37, 42, 54, 58] out of the remaining five
studies yielded an increased risk of death among women or
men not using dentures (Table 2). Interpretation of these
findings is, however, limited by the methodological quality
of the analyses (Table 5). One study [58] controlled only for
age and gender for each exposure group (but additionally
controlled tooth contacts for the exposure to denture use)
and each study lacked adjustment for gender [37], age [37]
or SES, including education and income [38, 42, 54, 58].
Only one study used risk modelling approaches [42]. None

of the studies followed up the population longer than
15 years. The empirical induction period was not analysed
by any of the studies. Most studies addressed mortality in
old (65–79 years) [37, 54, 58] or very old adults (≥80 years)
[38] and one of those specifically referred to institutional-
ised elderly [54].

Quality of selected studies on denture use and all-cause
mortality

Quality estimates of the studies that considered denture use
or related exposures in the relationship between dental status

and all-cause mortality are presented in Table 5. Based on
the proposed criteria, the quality scoring was low to
moderate. This quality scoring was improved using bias
analysis (Table 5). A valid statement on the effect of
denture use on all-cause mortality can only be assumed for
two Japanese studies [42, 58], which found that denture
non-use is a risk factor for mortality. These exposure effects
were changed less than 10% by SES in bias analyses (data
are given in Online Resource 1, Online Table 2, p 8), which
was expected mainly because wealth inequalities were
relatively low in Japan [73]. Therefore, we used the original
estimates in meta-analysis. The pooled estimate assuming

random effects of the overall risk in Yoshida et al. [58] and the
two gender-specific risks in Fukai et al. [42] yielded a hazard
ratio of 1.31 for denture non-users compared with denture
users (95% CI 1.03;1.65, using EPISHEET developed by
Rothman [19] version of June 11, 2008) (Fig. 2), indicating
an effect of prosthodontic replacements on mortality.

Discussion

In conducting a sound meta-analysis, we aimed for an
average effect across studies by using well-established
methods [34], which included state-of-the-art probabilistic
bias analysis on study level [35]. The findings of this
systematic review and meta-analysis, however, must be
considered in the context of the following potential
limitations. The small number of studies available for
analysis limits not only the generalisability of the results
but also the application of methods for detecting bias in meta-
analysis (for example, publication bias and language bias)
[74]. Moreover, possible sex differences could not be
addressed in the relation between oral health and circulatory
outcomes. The small number of studies included in this
review did not permit to evaluate the quality of the
assessment for circulatory mortality. Furthermore, we cannot
exclude potential bias in the original studies, for example,
because of measurement error or misclassification of
confounders.

Number of teeth and all-cause/circulatory mortality

The three high-quality studies [36, 47, 56] (Table 4)
revealed a relationship between the number of teeth and
circulatory mortality (Table 1). Therefore, the recommen-
dation regarding the number of teeth playing a causal role
with respect to circulatory mortality is assessed as level B
[32]. For the putative relationship between the number of
teeth and all-cause mortality, only one high-quality study
was found. Given the inconsistent results of moderate- and
high-quality studies (Tables 1 and 3), a recommendation
cannot be given [32].
At least three biological mechanisms are suggested for
the link between the number of teeth and mortality: (1)
inflammation, (2) infection and (3) diet and nutrition (for
further information about the biological mechanisms,
please refer to the supplementary material [Online
Resource 1, p 5]).
Each aforementioned pathway relates to a specific
confounder set and requires a corresponding induction
period. If, for example, a nutritional pathway was taken, it
would be unjustified to assume that having missing,
unreplaced teeth instantly leads to death, but it would be
reasonable to assume an induction period of at least 5 years,
as suggested by two studies by Nakanishi and colleagues
[75, 76]. They reported the effect of chewing disability on
mortality for a 9-year observation period, but did not
observe the outcome during the first 4.5 years of follow-up.

In addition, oral infection in the pathogenesis of coronary
heart disease has been postulated to be involved at a very
early stage of the disease [77]. As one cannot be sure about
the true induction period, statistical methods may be used to
estimate the most appropriate induction period [19]. This
methodological issue, however, has not been applied yet in
the reviewed research. Effects without appropriate allow-
ance for the empirical induction period are underestimated
[78]. Hence, it is not surprising that the reviewed studies
have found, if at all, only small effects of tooth loss on
mortality. The longer the supposed time sequence between
the exposure and the occurrence of the outcome, the more
crucial to analyse the empirical induction period. Under the
assumption of an induction period of at least 5 years, a
sample restricted to very old populations would decrease
the statistical power because very old subjects are likely to
die during the next 5 years [43, 44, 48, 55] before tooth loss
may have an effect on mortality. Moreover, the accumula-
tion of risk factors over a lengthy induction time compli-
cates to explore whether and to what extent is death a
consequence of oral risk factors and to identify the
underlying pathway. To avoid a long induction period,
intermediate stages are recommended to be observed [19].
Assessing intermediary variables, such as change in
inflammatory markers or gastrointestinal symptoms, may
elucidate how much of the putative effect of tooth loss on
mortality is carried by each pathway.
The diversity of exposures is a further limitation to
interpret and compare the studies. As has been discussed in
an earlier review, misclassification of the exposure status
can yield substantially biased parameter estimates [5]. The
suppositious biological pathway should determine the
exposure definition. If nutrition were assumed to be on
the pathway, it would be more appropriate to use the
number of unreplaced teeth as exposure of interest rather
than the number of missing teeth. For nutrition as

intermediate, it would be misleading to count the number
of missing teeth, when subjects had the same number of
missing teeth but different numbers of replaced teeth. In
contrast, if the inflammatory pathway were taken, peri-
odontal parameters or the number of missing teeth as a
surrogate for past periodontal disease may be more suitable.
Thereby periodontal disease should not be mixed with
categories of tooth loss in the exposure status because the
corresponding confounder sets may differ.
Confounding bias may further explain the inconsistent
patterns of the associations between mortality and the
number of teeth, albeit only few studies lacked adjustment
for major confounders. Smoking has considerable influence
on the development of clinically detectable periodontitis
[79], which eventually over a period of time leads to tooth
loss. As smoking is also an important risk factor for all-
cause and circulatory mortality [80], its non-consideration
or rough classification [81, 82] may have given rise to an
overestimation of tooth number-related effects on mortality
in some studies [39, 41, 43, 44, 50]. Residual confounding
because of smoking has not always been discussed [41, 43,
44, 49, 50], although it was known that the relationship
between periodontal and cardiovascular disease is prone to
this major limitation [83]. Similarly, not controlling
diabetes, body mass index or obesity as surrogates limits
the validity of some findings [41, 43, 44, 46, 49, 50, 52, 55]
because diabetes is an important risk factor of periodontal
disease and strongly associated with increased mortality
and thereby confounding the relationship between tooth
loss and mortality [84].
Studies examining circulatory mortality (Table 1) might
have lacked statistical power and were expected to have
lower validity than studies of similar size that examined
fatal events from all causes. Nevertheless, there was a
higher evidence for circulatory mortality compared with all-
cause mortality, which could, on the other hand, be
expected because circulatory diseases are linked to both
major pathways. Moreover, the number of competing risk
factors for circulatory mortality is smaller compared with
those for all-cause mortality. Thus, putative effects of the
number of teeth on circulatory mortality may be less
attenuated.

Denture use and all-cause mortality

In view of the amount of research on the relation between
tooth loss and mortality, very few [37, 38, 42, 53, 54, 58]
involved prosthodontic aspects and, to the best of our
knowledge, the number of unreplaced teeth has not been
addressed in this relationship yet. Therefore, denture (non-)
use served as a proxy for the exposure to unreplaced teeth
in this review (Table 2). Because of low- to moderate-
quality studies (Table 5), especially regarding confounding

bias, the recommendation for a causal relationship between
denture use and all-cause mortality is graded with level D.
However, under the assumptions we chose for the bias
analysis, an effect of denture use on all-cause mortality
would be present.
Albeit relying on moderate level of evidence from
two studies [42, 58], findings insinuate a protective effect
of prostheses on survival in the elderly, which seems to
increase with decreasing number of natural teeth and is at
least present for subjects who have lost any occlusal
contact on natural teeth [58] or edentulous individuals
[54].
The same limitations as for studies on the number of
teeth are present in studies on the exposure to denture use
(Table 5). Particularly, lack of adjustment for SES is likely
to bias the relationship between denture use and mortality,
since higher income and higher educational levels may
reduce mortality risk and privilege to get missing teeth
replaced, at least in Western countries [29]. Additionally,
the number of remaining natural teeth primarily determines
the type of prosthesis and chewing ability and may,
therefore, be a further variable that merits adjustment, as
demonstrated by Fukai et al. [42] and supported by the
DAG analysis (as stated above).
Misclassification of the unexposed reference category
[85], as for example mixing dentate individuals who do not
need dentures and individuals with missing or no teeth who
do not use dentures [38], two extremely different dental
status categories implying just as different chewing ability,
could have made it difficult to detect a cause–effect
relationship or distorted the relationship. Ill-fitting dentures
may evoke denture stomatitis, allowing oral microorgan-
isms to enter the bloodstream via mucosal lesions [60, 86],
which may represent a further pathway besides nutrition in
which the prosthodontic status acts. None of the studies
[37, 38, 42, 54, 58, 87], however, enhanced the specificity
of prosthodontic exposure definitions by quality (fixed or
removable) of prostheses.
The majority of study participants were old (65–79 years)
or very old (≥80 years), thereby limiting generalisability of
the findings for younger populations. Older individuals
may have been longer exposed to tooth loss and showing
advanced alveolar bone resorption to the disadvantage of
denture retention and stability and even more impaired
chewing function [88]. For further details, please refer to
the Supplementary discussion section of the Online
Resource 1 on pp 5 and 6.

Conclusions and recommendations for further research

Given results demonstrated by well-designed studies for
circulatory mortality and the limitations of the reviewed

studies for all-cause mortality, it is open whether competing
risks of cause-specific death other than circulatory mortality
reduce an effect of the number of teeth on all-cause
mortality. An effect of denture use on circulatory mortality
remains to be established, as well as how the number of
replaced teeth affects mortality.
Drawing on lessons learned, we offer some constructive
recommendations for mortality research, which may address
essential problems of the topic of this review and beyond
[34].

1.
Hypothesise different induction periods and reanalyse
the data under each separate hypothesis. Define
exposure variable dichotomously to allow combining
the person-time of exposed subjects that is not related
to the exposure (under the hypothesis of a specific
induction time) with follow-up time of subjects who
were never exposed.
2.
Draw samples of adults not older than 65 years.
3.
Assess change in exposure and use corresponding
models with time-dependent variables.
4.
Define the exposure according to the hypothesised
pathway (periodontal disease or number of unreplaced
teeth). Avoid mixing different types of exposure
variables and choose a valid definition of the unex-
posed reference condition.
5.
Assess confounders appropriately (including smoking,
diabetes and income, with respect to prosthodontic
replacements); avoid prediction models.
6.
At least for the nutrition pathway, exclude subjects with
history of cancer because they are likely to have
changed dietary patterns and lost teeth.

Future research on the effect of tooth loss on mortality
can essentially benefit from sophisticated methodological
approaches. Acknowledging the aforementioned items may
reduce bias in the design and analysis of epidemiological
studies and substantiate the contribution of coexisting
causal pathways to the exposure effect. Specifying the role
of potential pathways by which tooth loss-related mortality
is mediated will possibly increase the value of restorative
and periodontal interventions for general health, with regard
to cost-effectiveness of preventive strategies for healthy
ageing as well.
