The association of tooth loss with all-cause and circulatory mortality. Is there a benefit of replaced teeth? A systematic review and meta-analysis Ines Polzer & Christian Schwahn & Henry Völzke & Torsten Mundt & Reiner Biffar Received: 14 December 2010 / Accepted: 4 October 2011 / Published online: 
17 November 2011 #Springer-Verlag 2011 Abstract We systematically reviewed whether the number of teeth is related to all-cause or circulatory mortality and whether replaced teeth are protective against all-cause or circulatory mortality. The search was based on the PubMed database. All cohort studies 
published in peer-reviewed journals were selected. Studies on periodontal disease and mortality were excluded if they did not provide information on the number of teeth. Risk estimates from studies with appropriate exposure definition, confounder adjustment and sample size were included in a meta-analysis. 
Three high-quality studies found a relationship between the number of teeth and circulatory mortality, whereas a moderate study did not. Two out of four moderate- to high-quality studies reported a relationship between the number of teeth and all-cause mortality. No study has investigated whether replaced 
teeth are protective against mortality. Therefore, denture use was taken as a proxy. The methodological quality of studies on denture use and mortality was generally low to moderate. The findings of two moderate studies indicate an effect of prosthodontic replacements on all-cause mortality, which was 
supported in bias analysis. It is open whether competing risks of cause-specific death other than circulatory mortality reduce an effect of the number of teeth on all-cause mortality. An effect of denture use on circulatory mortality remains to be established, as well as whether the number of replaced 
teeth affects mortality. Specifying the role of potential pathways by which tooth loss-related mortality is mediated will possibly increase the value of dental treatment for general health. Keywords Mortality. Prospective studies.Dentalprosthesis. Tooth loss. Meta-analysis Introduction The number of teeth is 
discussed to predict all-cause and circulatory mortality. Two major pathways may mediate this relationship, including (1) the effects of masticatory dysfunction on dietary behaviour, nutrition and systemic diseases [1–4] and (2) the inflammatory effects of chronic periodontal infection on the circulatory 
system [5–7]. If Tooth loss was a risk factor, it's attributable fraction will be relevant because it is more common [8], from younger age onwards, than hypertension [9] as one of the primary predictors of circulatory mortality. The role of the prosthodontic status has been rarely examined for the possible 
relationship between the number of teeth and mortality [10]. If the rehabilitation of missing teeth by wearing dental prostheses has the potential to change masticatory efficiency and diet [11–13], replacing missing teeth may hypothetically have an effect on mortality. The prosthodontic status is a 
time-dependent exposure, as further tooth loss may occur or missing teeth be replaced. If tooth loss is measured at baseline only, it risk on mortality is underestimated because some subjectsInes Polzer and Christian Schwahn contributed equally to this work.

will improve their prosthodontic status (receive a prosthesis for missing teeth during the observation period) and some subjects will deteriorate (loose teeth during the observation period without replacement). Such non-differential misclas-sification following the baseline examination was described earlier 
for the risk of periodontal disease on cardiovascular disease [14]. Consequently, a long observation period is not only linked with a higher chance for changes in the dental status but it is also preferable to observe fatal events. A highly relevant methodological factor for judging whether tooth loss or 
prosthodontic replacement plays a causal role for mortality is to consider the concept of confounding. A confounder is related both to the outcome and the exposure, and non-considering a confounder may overestimate the exposure effect. On the other hand, aconfounder may also suppress the relationship of 
interest. To choose appropriate confounder sets, an innovative epidemiologic tool, namely, directed acyclic graphs(DAGs), has been suggested [15–17]. This combined analytical and graphical approach allows alternative con-founder sets and may be particularly instructive for systematic reviews. Based on these 
methodological aspects, we systematically reviewed (1) whether the number of teeth is related to all-cause or circulatory mortality and (2) whether replaced teeth are protective against all-cause or circulatory mortality. Materials and methodsSearch strategyLiterature searches were independently executed by 
three of the authors (I.P., C.S. and H.V.) using two strategies. Firstly, the PubMed database (1966 to May 2010) was screened to detect articles published in the English Language on the association between the number of teeth and all-cause mortality/circulatory mortality or replaced teeth and all-cause 
mortality/circulatory mortality. The search was restricted to studies on human subjects by selecting the respective option provided by the PubMedsearch engine. For assessing a putative lifetime effect of the number of teeth, the Boolean search formulation was:(tooth OR teeth OR “tooth  loss ”OR“ tooth  number 
”OR“ number of teeth '' OR“ dental disease ”OR“ dental status ”) AND ( survival OR mortality OR death OR fatal OR lethal). To evaluate a putative beneficial effect of prostho-dontic replacements, the Boolean search formulation was:(“replaced teeth ''OR denture OR“ dental prosthesis ”OR“ dental prostheses '' OR 
PDO RFPD) AND (survival OR mortality OR death OR fatal OR lethal ). Secondly, after the electronic search, manual searches were made through reference lists from original research and review articles. Study selection All cohort studies published in peer-reviewed journals were considered for the present 
review. Studies on the association between the number of teeth and non-fatal circulatory events were excluded, as were studies on periodontal disease and mortality if they did not provide information on the number of teeth. Highly selected study populations were a further criterion for exclusion.
Quality assessment of selected studies The selected studies were assessed for the exposure, the intermediates, the sample size and the confounders. With Respect to confounding, we classified the studies into risk and prediction models [18]. In a risk model, a confounder is associated with both the outcome 
and the exposure, but must not be an effect of the exposure [19]. To assess a confounder , it would not be appropriate to use stepwise selection procedures because they ignore the relation between the risk factor and the exposure. Stepwise modelling makes more sense for prediction models [19]. The sample size 
is considered insufficient if less than ten outcome events per variable were available in prediction models or five events per variable in risk models [20]. If the number of events is less than the corresponding critical value, the results may be biased and should be cautiously interpreted [20]. Potential 
confounders. Many confounders (age [21, 22], sex [21, 22], social determinants such as socioeconomic status (SES) and marital status [22, 23], smoking [21–24], risky alcohol consumption[23, 24], physical activity [23, 25], metabolic factors such as diabetes and obesity [21–23], serum lipids such as 
triglycer-ides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [26, 27], hypertension [22, 28], oralhealth behaviour [23, 25], periodontitis [29, 30] and caries[31]) have been considered for the relationship between the number of teeth and mortality. To reduce such a high number 
of potential confounders to minimal adjustment sets that are sufficient to control confounding, the DAG approach was used [16, 17]; for example, in Online Fig.1 (Online Resource1, p 9), the DAG for the teeth–mortality relation is drawn(generated by DAGitty v0.9b available athttp://www.dagitty.net/dags.html). 
The confounder selection depends on the exposure of interest [19]. We investigated the effect of the number of teeth (I) or related oral exposures (number of contacts on natural teeth, II; presence of prostheses, III;number of unreplaced teeth, IV). The obtained minimally sufficient adjustment sets for 
different oral exposures (I–IV)used in selected studies and under different assumptions are presented in Online Table1 (Online Resource1,p7).334Clin Oral Invest (2012) 16:333–351
The DAG approach clarifies that an exposure mixture of oral variables may be misleading. Moreover, the problem of residual confounding by smoking, which has been extensively discussed for the relationship between oral exposures and circulatory outcomes, may potentially be avoided by using DAGs. Based on 
extensive DAG analysis, smoking and diabetes as the clinically most important (except periodontal disease) were considered for the quality assessment of studies with the exposure to the number of teeth. Age, sex, social determinants (SES) and the number of teeth were considered for the quality assessment 
of the studies on denture useor related exposures. Additional methodological information on the selection of potential confounders based on DAGs is given in Online Resource1 (pp 2 and 3).Quality criteria Exposure and intermediates (A–D)(A)  Empirical induction period.

Since theClin Oral Invest (2012) 16:333–351335
The relation between the number of natural or replaced teeth and mortality should not be examined within the scope of randomised clinical trials for ethical reasons, the highest possible level of recommendation is B, evidence based on cohort studies. Given evidence based on low- to moderate-quality cohort studies, the level of recommendation will be C.Bias analysisFor the putative relationship between prosthodontic replacements and mortality, SES may be an important confounder,which is supported by DAGs (Online Resource1, OnlineTable1, p 7). If published results were not adjusted for SES,the effect of missing prosthodontic replacements on mortality is likely to be overestimated. The lack of confounder control can be diminished by bias analyses as recommended by experts for meta-analysis [34]. Here, we performed a probabilistic bias analysis [35] and chose study-specific bias assumptions as described in the supplementary material(Online Resource 1, pp 3 and 4). To decide for a relevant bias, we used the change-in-estimate criterion for risk models,which is usually fixed for a 10% change [19]. The simulation estimate and its interval, which are reflections of the combined data and bias analysis assumptions, were added to the conventional estimate and confidence interval in Table2.ResultsGeneral description of selected studiesApplying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, in total, 23cohort studies [36–58] were selected for qualitative synthe-sis (Fig.1).As to the database search on tooth loss and mortality, six investigations [37, 38, 42, 54, 58, 59] were assigned to the denture use analysis. Other studies were not considered since they assessed tooth loss solely as an exposure category of periodontal disease [60–64], treated the number of teeth as a score variable [65, 66] or a confounding variable only [67] or no quantitative data have been given[68, 69]. One study was excluded for evaluating only incident tooth loss [70]. Between two studies [43, 44], an overlap of 94 subjects existed. Because the exposures were defined differently, both reports were included. Finally,three studies [25, 71, 72] were excluded for not assessing fatal events of disease separately from non-fatal outcomes.There was no study on the relationship between the number of replaced teeth and mortality. Therefore, denture use was taken as a proxy. As to the eligibility of denture-related studies,on investigation [59] was excluded, being based on data also used in another publication [37]. Two studies reported no quantitative data and were, therefore, not included [57, 60].A descriptive summary of the selected studies is given inTables1 and   2; declared risk factors were not restricted to those in the final model. Most of the studies were conducted in Europe [37, 40, 43–46, 49, 50, 52, 55–57]orJapan[38,41, 42, 48, 54, 58], four in the United States [39, 47, 51, 53]and one in China [36]. Study participants were recruited from the general population [36–46, 48–53, 57, 58], nursing facilities [54], registers [47, 55]andhra university hospital[56]. Sample sizes ranged widely from 94 [43]to41,000subjects [39] in studies on all-cause mortality and from 1,462[40] to 58,974 subjects [47] in studies on circulatory mortality (Table1). In studies that considered denture ideas exposure, the range was 697 [38] to 1,929 subjects [54](Table2).Denture-related studies did not analyse circulatory mortality as an outcome. Similarly, the follow-up times differedandwereatminimum5[43] or 6 years [47] and at maximum57 years [56] in studies on all-cause or circulatory mortality(Table1). In studies exploring the putative relation between denture use and mortality (Table2), there were shorter observation periods of 4 [38]to15years[37].Number of teeth and all-cause/circulatory mortalityThere were 15 studies [36, 39–41, 43–46, 48–52, 55, 56]that investigated the relation between the number of teeth and all-cause mortality and 9 studies[36, 39, 40, 46, 47, 49, 52, 56,57] that investigated the effect on circulatory  mortality(Table1). Irrespective of the assessed quality, 12 [36, 39–41,43–46, 49–51, 55] out of 15 studies reported an increased risk of unspecific death among women or men with higher numbers of missing teeth, while 7 [36, 39, 40, 46, 47, 49, 56]out of 9 studies revealed increased circulatory mortality.Study findings are limited by low number of events [20]in relation to the number of variables in the final model (forall-cause  mortality: Table3 [48, 51] and for circulatory mortality: Table4 [57]). Notably, in one study [57], sample size considerations were not reported, although statistically non-significant findings were yielded for a low number of events. Findings are further limited by using prediction models [43, 44, 49–51, 55]. Moreover, the confounder sets of the studies were quite heterogeneous. Few risk models lacked adjustment for clinically relevant confounders such as smoking [39, 41] and diabetes [41, 46, 52](Tables 3 And  4).Potential residual confounding by smoking was addressed in three studies by performing sensitivity analysis [36], using the number of cigarettes per day for current and former smokers [47], or stratifying by smoking status [56]. Tu et al.[56] reported separate analyses for smokers and non-smokers only for the association between tooth loss and circulatory mortality; for that relationship, the methodological quality scoring was, therefore, higher (Table4)danforth all-cause mortality analyses (Table3). Four studies [39, 45, 46, 52]discussed residual confounding qualitatively without trying 336 Clin Oral Invest (2012) 16:333–351
to quantify the effect, for instance, in a bias analysis.Quantification of the bias effect would have been advisable at least for Brown et al. [39]. In contrast, over-adjustment might be present for vitamin supplementation [47].Different exposure definitions, namely, dichotomous (for example, >10 teeth), log-linear (continuous number of teeth)or potentially non-log-linear (categories, fractional polyno-mials), were used across studies (Table1). Two studies [49,56], having found a higher mortality risk, specified whether a linear exposure effect could be assumed. Whereas one study[49] revealed linearity, the other did not [56]. Notably, in two studies [36, 50], the number of teeth was not examined by dental professionals. In a study of health professionals,participants indicated their number of teeth (0, 1–10, 11–16,17–24, 25–32 teeth) in a self-administered questionnaire[47]. Change in exposures or time-dependent variables were analysed by Hung et al. [47]only.All studies had an observation period of at least 5 years.Four studies followed up the population for more than15 years [40, 45, 49, 56]. The empirical induction period was not analysed. The age ranged from 16 [56] to at least85 years [43] at baseline. Some studies specifically investigated mortality in elderly (65–79 years) [45, 49,50] or very old populations (=80 years) [43, 44, 48, 55].Two studies observed selected samples for which high health awareness may be assumed [47, 56].Quality of selected studies on the number of teeth and all-cause/circulatory mortalitySummary results of the quality assessment are presented for studies on all-cause mortality in Table3 and for studies on circulatory  mortality in Table4.
